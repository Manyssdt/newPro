# SSDT Training

| [English Version](#) | [Polish Version](pl/README.md) |

All code from full ssdt training.  

SSDT is a great tool if you're looking for a solution to manage and deploy your SQL Server database or Azure SQL databases. It's a free tool from Microsoft (provided within Visual Studio), but sometimes we don't know how to start and how to:  
* Import existing database(s) from a physical server
* Use DACPAC file and what's that?
* Understand the concept and use SQLPackage
* Build end-to-end CI/CD process

I've been working with SSDT for many years now. This repository contains a code for all demo of comprehensive online-course I prepared this year (2020).  
Take a look if you're interested. The whole course is available here:  
**Polish edition:** http://ssdt.kursysql.pl/  
**English edition:** (see below)

The first edition is in Polish language only.  
The English edition gonna be available next (2021) year. 

Enjoy!
